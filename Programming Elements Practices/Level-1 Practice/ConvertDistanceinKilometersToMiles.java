/*
Create a program to convert distance in kilometers to miles.
Hint => 
Create a variable km and assign type as double as in double km;
Create Scanner Object to take user input from Standard Input that is the Keyboard as in Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
Use Scanner Object to take user input for km as in km = input.nextInt();
Use 1 mile = 1.6 km formulae to calculate miles and show the output
I/P => km
O/P => The total miles is ___ mile for the given ___ km
